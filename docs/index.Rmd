Below is a visual representation of the Global Monthly Means-Anomalies for the Combined Land-Surface Air &
Sea-Surface Water Temperature data, as provided by
[NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/),
where "anomaly" is defined as the deviation from the long term mean in degrees Celsius,
and this long term period is currently defined as the years 1951-1980:
