Below is a visual representation the Global Monthly Means-Anomalies for the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature data,
as provided by [NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), where "anomaly" is defined as the 
deviation from the long term mean in degrees Celsius, for which the long term period is 1951-1980:
